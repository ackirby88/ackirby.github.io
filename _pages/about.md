Welcome to my page! I'm an Associate Research Scientist in the School of Computing at the University of Wyoming. Currently, I'm leading computational research projects in the fields of Wind Energy and Aerospace, including work with NREL and Scientific Simulations LLC. In the past, I worked at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the Supercomputing Group (LLSC), directed by <a href='http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/'>Dr. Jeremy Kepner</a>, as a Postdoctoral Associate developing advanced parallel algorithms for Deep Learning.

I did my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wyoming under the direction of <a href='http://www.scientific-sims.com/cfdlab/Dimitri_Mavriplis/HOME/'>Professor Dimitri Mavriplis</a> where I worked on the development of high-order numerical methods for multiscale computational fluid dynamics problems. During my Ph.D. studies, I was fortunate to be selected as an <a href='https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/fellowships/2016'>NSF Blue Waters Graduate Fellow</a>, in which I performed the highest-fidelity blade-resolved wind farm simulations to date on leadership-class supercomputers! Additionally, I spent several months working with the U.S. ARMY's CREATE-AV HELIOS Team at NASA Ames Research Center on my doctoral research. Before changing to the dark side of computational mathematics and engineering, I did a M.S. at Columbia University in Applied Mathematics, and a B.S. in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. During my time at those universities, I got to work with some wonderful people including <a href='https://www.apam.columbia.edu/faculty/marc-spiegelman'>Marc Spiegelman</a> (APAM Columbia) and <a href='https://people.math.wisc.edu/~jeanluc/'>Jean-Luc Thiffeault</a> (Math UW-Madison).
