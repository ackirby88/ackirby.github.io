Much of my research focuses around the application of wind energy and developing predictive physics software tools.
The goal of this research is to develop aerodynamically-accurate simulation software whereby the wind turbine models 
are resolved geometrically (known as blade resolved) in contrast to lower-fidelity models which used parameterized models 
to generate wakes. Though the development of our multiscale CFD tool, WAKE3D, we are able to solve problems with spatial scales 
ranging from 10+ km all the way down to a fraction of a micron at the blade! Some highlights regarding this work are shown below 
including the highest fidelity simulation of a wind turbine to date.
