My primary research revolves around developing high-fidelity numerical methods for Computional Fluid Dynamics problems with applications to Wind Energy and Aerospace.
This involves principally writing code de novo as the problems we target require leadership-class supercomputing capabilities. 
My research vision is to develop highly-scalable and highly-efficient algorithms coupling scientific computation with data-informed modeling suitable for leadership-class heterogeneous supercomputers and to facilitate industry-ready engineering simulations tools applicable to the fields of aerospace and renewable energy. Some of the codes I have developed are outlined here.
