Via solver technology development, we work towards advancing the aerospace design space through CFD.
Using our WAKE3D framework, we have studied many problems spanning fixed- and propeller-wing aircraft, including participation in the [AIAA High Lift Prediction Workshop](https://hiliftpw.larc.nasa.gov/) series. Additionally, we have studied jet-propulsion flows focused around aeroacoustics. Much of this work is guided by the [NASA CFD Vision 2030](https://www.cfd2030.com/).
